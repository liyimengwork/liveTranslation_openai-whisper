# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

### Steps
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liveTranslation_openai-whisper.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd liveTranslation_openai-whisper`
3. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration
Set up your API keys in `config.yaml`:
1. Rename `config.yaml.default` to `config.yaml`
2. Enter your API keys in the `config.yaml` file:
```yaml
openai:
  api_key: "Your-OpenAI-API-Key"
groq:
  api_key: "Your-Groq-API-Key"
```

## Command-Line Interface (main.py)
Execute with `python main.py` and the following optional flags:
- `-d <seconds>`: Set the duration for audio capture.
- `-f <filename.wav>`: Translate from an existing audio file.
- `-c <language>`: Choose a specific language or use `Smart Select` for automatic detection.
- `-t`: Enable continuous translation mode. (No Spacebar toggle record)
- `-v <voice_name>`: Activate text-to-speech for the translated text.

### Usage Examples

- 4-second live translation in European Spanish with toggle recording
  
`python main.py -d 4 -c "European Spanish (Spain)"`

---

- 10-second live translation in continuous mode with Smart Select

`python main.py -d 10 -t -c "Smart Select"`

---

- Translate an existing audio file with Shimmer's voice
  
`python main.py -f audioFileName.wav -v shimmer`

---
